## Introduction
This is a solo project from the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) The Frontend Career Path.
This project is a simple app about Endorsements. It is a simple app that allows you to add, edit, and delete endorsements. It also allows you to filter the endorsements by the name of the person who gave the endorsement.
The app is built with Vite and Firebase.

## Project Requirements

- The app should be responsive
- The app should have a landing page with a list of endorsements.

- Update in real-time

## Stretch goal:
- Add From and To input fields to the form
- Reverse the order of the endorsements
- Add likes(the person who uses the app can like one or more endorsements only once)
- The app should have a form that allows users to add new endorsements.
- The app should have a form that allows users to edit existing endorsements.
- The app should have a form that allows users to delete existing endorsements.
